        <p>To ensure accurate tracking of work hours and maintain transparency, the following guidelines for time logging are now in effect:</p>

      <!-- Guidelines Section -->
      <div class="card shadow-sm">
        <div class="card-body">
          <h5 class="card-title">Mandatory Time Log Submission:</h5>
          <p class="card-text">
            Every employee is required to fill in their daily time logs. This helps us maintain proper records and ensures timely reporting of project activities.
          </p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Restricted Access for Older Dates:</h5>
          <p class="card-text">
            Employees can log their time for the current week and last week only. Once a week passes, older dates will be faded out and locked, making them unavailable for editing. Please ensure your logs are updated on time.
          </p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Focus on Accuracy:</h5>
          <p class="card-text">
            Submit accurate time logs reflecting your tasks, projects, and hours worked. This is critical for project billing, resource planning, and performance evaluation.
          </p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Accountability:</h5>
          <p class="card-text">
            Keeping your time logs updated is part of your responsibility as an employee. Failure to submit logs on time may lead to escalations.
          </p>
